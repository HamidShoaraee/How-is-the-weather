# How Is The Weather
In this project, we want to get raw data from the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) and transform this data for creating interactive reports and a dashboard in Power BI. The goal of this project is turning raw weather data into interactive visualization with help of Microsoft Power BI and Python visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Pandas.

**climate_station_list.csv has all the weather stations in entire Canada.**

**Transformer.py do all the ETL tasks**

**How is the weather.pbix includes all the datasets, report, and dashboard in Power BI**

**csv files are transform data from the main dataset** 

**How is The Weathter.pdf is the PDF version of Microsoft Power BI report**
