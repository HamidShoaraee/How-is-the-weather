# How is the weather
In this notebook, we want to get raw data from the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) and transform this data for creating interactive reports and dashboards in Power BI. This project is an introduction to how to turn raw data to interactive visualization with help of Microsoft Power BI and visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Pandas.

**climate_station_list.csv has all the weather stations in entire Canada.**

**Transformer.py do all the ETL tasks**
 
**HoW is the weather.pbix includes all the datasets, report, and dashboard in Power BI**
